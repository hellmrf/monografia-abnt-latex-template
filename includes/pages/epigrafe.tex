        \textit{\TeX{} is a new typesetting system intended for the creation of beautiful books --- and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics. By preparing a manuscript in \TeX{} format, you are telling a computer exactly how the manuscript is to be transformed into pages whose typographic quality is comparable to that of the world's finest printers.}
